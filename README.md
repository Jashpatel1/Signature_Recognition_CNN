# Signature_Recognition_CNN

Recognition is regarded as a fundamental attribute of human beings. 
Signatures are used in everyday life to sign millions of important documents and sanction thousands of monetary transfers. 
The main aim of our project is to identify counterfeit signatures using an existing dataset of signatures.
Initially, the signature is pre-processed using the following steps and it is then fed to the convolutional neural network: 
Converting raw image to grayscale, binarization, auto-cropping and filtering.
Using the above feature extraction steps over normal processing provides us with a highly efficient layout to be fed.
